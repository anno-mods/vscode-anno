# Get Started

## How to Get

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install the [Anno Modding Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JakobHarder.anno-modding-tools) plugin.

## How to Open Files

Most features only activate if you a open folder (e.g. `File` > `Open Folder...`) that includes one or more full mods (detected by `modinfo.json`).

You can also work with parent folders, or your complete `mods/` folder.

??? info "The plugin will prompt you to select your game path."

    You can adjust that manually. Go to `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` and search for `anno` to configure the following:

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    - `Anno.*: Game Path`: path to your Anno installation (1)
    </div>

    1.  For example `C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Anno 117 - Pax Romana`.

    See also the [Setup](./setup.md) page for detailed documentation.
