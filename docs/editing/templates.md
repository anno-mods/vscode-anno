# Templates

You can create mods from templates with a structure of common mod files:

 - either globally with `F1` > `Anno: Create Mod from Template`,
 - or at a specific location by right clicking on a folder in the Explorer view > `Anno: Create Mod from Template`

The command creates a folder with the Mod ID (asked by input box) and the following files in their correct path:

- modinfo.json with mandatory entries
- README.md
- assets.xml
- texts_english.xml
- common folders
